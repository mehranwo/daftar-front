### Sign In with Google Workspace

Sign In with Google means your team doesn't have to worry about invites, passwords, or managing new team members. Everyone on your team can login with their existing Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) account and will automatically join your private knowledge base.

> Note: Your team will also get a matching custom subdomain that you can link to from elsewhere.
