![Outline full bleed image](/images/image-layout.png)

This week brings an additional layout option for images on Outline. You can now
choose the "full-width" option to extend images to the edges of the page past
the text content.

This works particularly well for wide pictures and photos, such as banners and
headings across a documnt and for larger images with a white background where
they can fill up more of screen by default.

The new layout is available by selecting an image and then choosing the "full-width"
option in the toolbar that appears.
