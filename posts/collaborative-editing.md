This week weâ€™re beginning to accept teams into the beta of collaborative editing,
this feature will allow multiple team members to edit the same document at the same
time, opening much wider range of use cases! It also lays the foundation for all
sorts of new features such as commenting.

If your team would like to participate please reach out to [hello@getoutline.com](mailto:hello@getoutline.com).
