![Outline export options](/images/json-export.png)

Outline now supports importing and exporting documents in JSON format. This is useful for migrating data between Outline instances, or for backing up your data in a format
that retains more information than a lossy Markdown export.

We also recently added HTML export, which can be used for archiving your data in a format that can be viewed directly in a browser.
