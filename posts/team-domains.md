![team domain restrictions](/images/team-domains.png)

This week brings two new security settings. It's now possible to restrict all sign-ups
to your team to a specific domain name through "Allowed domains". This setting applies in _addition_ to
SSO and will disallow users from creating accounts that do not have a confirmed
matching email domain.

We also added the ability to restrict sign-ups through SSO completely, so that
users must first be invited by an admin. Both of these new settings can be found
under **Settings** -> **Security**.
