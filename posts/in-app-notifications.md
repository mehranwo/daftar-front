Building on last months release of comments, this month brings in-app notifications
support so you can quickly catch up on what's happening in your workspace and
jump straight to the relevant document.

### Collection admins

We also added the ability to make members admins in specific collections, this
new role allows members to manage the collection details, including adding and
removing other workspace members.

Regular collection membership no longer allows members to manage the collection
– see the documentation for more detail on permissions.
