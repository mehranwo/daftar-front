This week brings support for the beginnings of custom theming. You can now
change the accent color for your team to match your own brand which will be
reflected throughout the UI.

### Other fixes and improvements

- `Escape` now defocuses the editor when typing
- When selecting text and opening the link menu matching documents will now immediately
  be shown.
- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to tab and scroll on images on mobile
- It's now possible to upload multiple files at once from the block menu
