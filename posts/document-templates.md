Today we’re adding the much-requested ability to create team document templates in Outline.
Templates are a simple, but powerful way to keep your docs consistent and reliable. In 
the near future we’ll also publish recommended templates and make them easy to use from 
within your team.

### How to create a template

There are two ways to create a template:

1. Navigate to "Templates" in the left sidebar, then hit "New template…" in the top right, 
choose a collection and write your template.
2. Find an existing doc that you would like to create a template from, click on the overflow menu "..." (usually in the top right) and then "Create template…".

Once you’re editing a template, simply highlight some text and click on the new "placeholder" icon in the toolbar to convert the text into a placeholder that can be filled out by anyone that creates a new doc from the template.


### How to use a template

Simply start a new doc, a "Templates" option will appear in the top right corner until the 
document is first saved.
