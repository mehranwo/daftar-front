All workspaces now have access to a new [Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4) integration, by adding
your own Measurement ID
it will be embedded in all public and team documents in your workspace allowing
your team to measure views and activity across the knowledge base.

To use the integration you will first need to create a new GA4 property in your
Google Analytics account, then copy the [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356) to the settings page
in Outline at _Integrations_ -> _Google Analytics_.
