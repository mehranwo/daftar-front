![Outline on macOS](/images/pwa.png)

This week brings PWA support to Outline, allowing you to install the app to your
desktop and dock in just a couple of seconds. We've been enjoying how lightweight
this install is while keeping the two best parts of a native app experience â€“ an 
icon in the dock and a dedicated window. To try it out, head over to [the app](https://app.getoutline.com), signin, and 
**hit the "Install" button that appears in the address bar**.
