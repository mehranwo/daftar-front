![JSFiddle embed](/images/new-embeds.png)

This week brings three new integrations – just paste a share link in any
document to get a rich, interactive, embed.

- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) – an online IDE for writing and testing code snippets ("fiddles") in the browser.
- [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/) – an enterprise diagramming tool for creating flow charts, database diagrams, and wireframes.
- [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) – allows interactive annotated meeting notes to be embedded in documents.
