![Outline Public Sharing](/images/public-sharing-improvements.png)

Last week brings some great improvements to public document sharing. We recently simplified the sharing dialog to a popover and now added the ability to share an entire tree of nested documents too. This much-requested feature is great for sharing structured help docs or several related documents with a single link!

As an additional security measure the Share button will also display a globe icon if a document is shared publicly because one of it's parents has been shared.

### Other fixes and improvements

- Images now show a Download button for easy downloading of images in a document
- In the share dialog see when the link was last accessed
- Improved behavior when typing words that include underscores in the editor
- Improved behavior with the cursor around the edges of inline code
- Added support for [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) embeds
