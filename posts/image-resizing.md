![Resizing images in Outline](/images/resizing-images.gif)

It is now possible to resize images in Outline. This is a feature that has been
requested for a long time and we're excited to finally ship another foundational
feature.

When editing simply drag the handles on the image to change the size. Images snap to a
grid to help in alignment.
