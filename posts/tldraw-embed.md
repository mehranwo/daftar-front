Thanks to an open source contributor [Limezy](https://github.com/Limezy), we now
have support for interactive tldraw embeds. These look really fantastic inside
Outline and allow multiple people to draw together inside a document.

To get started head to [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com), click on the
cursors icon in the top left and select "Create a Multiplayer Project" â€“ paste
the url into an Outline doc.
