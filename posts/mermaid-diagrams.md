We're excited to have full support for [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) diagrams in Outline. Mermaid is a simple markdown-like syntax for generating diagrams and flowcharts from text. It's a great way to add diagrams of all types directly in your documentation.

You can insert a Mermaid diagram directly into a document by using the /mermaid slash command or by setting the code block language to "Mermaid Diagram".

Here's an example of a flowchart:

![Mermaid diagram](/images/mermaid-diagram-source.png)

Which renders as:

![Mermaid diagram](/images/mermaid-diagram.png)

For full documentation on all the syntax and types of graphs that can be created be sure to check out the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
