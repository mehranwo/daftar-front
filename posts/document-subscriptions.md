Sometimes you want to keep an eye on a document without having to open it, or you want to be notified when a document is updated. You can now subscribe to documents to receive notifications when they are updated by other team members. To subscribe to any document, click the "Subscribe" button in any document menu or access through the command menu with `cmd`+`k` on macOS. (`ctrl`+`k` on Windows/Linux).

You will automatically be subscribed to a document when you create or edit it, but you can unsubscribe at any time.
