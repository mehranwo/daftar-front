The collaborative editing beta has been progressing well and we continue to let
it new teams. The last few weeks have largely been spent fixing and improving
this functionality for a broader launch, but some other things snuck in tooâ€¦

- You can now also zoom images when editing a document, click once to select and again to zoom once selected
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Polish added as a user interface language option
- Fixed active starred documents being highlighted twice in the sidebar
- Fixed some occurances where a formatting toolbar could appear for an empty selection
- Headings and code blocks are now togglable in the editor
- The formatting toolbar now includes list options
- Lists can now start at numbers other than 1 ðŸ™ˆ
