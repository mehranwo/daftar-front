![Outline link previews](/images/link-previews.png)

This week brings the addition of hover previews, you can now see the details
of internal documents, mentioned users, _and_ external links when hovering over
them in the editor. We have built the system to be extensible so that previews of
authenticated integrations (think GitHub, Linear, etc) can be added in the near
future too.

Hover over any link in a document or comment to see the new functionality.
