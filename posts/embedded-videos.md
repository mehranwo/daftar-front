You can now upload videos and embed a player directly into any Outline document. Just like images,
we also added the ability to resize the video to fit and write a custom caption.

To embed a video simply drag and drop into the document, or find the "Video" option in [the block menu](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/guide/doc/blocks-iwAQVA8kAf).
For more information checkout [our guide](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/guide/doc/blocks-iwAQVA8kAf) to inserting blocks on Outline.
