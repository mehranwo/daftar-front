Since the launch of [viewer permissions](/changelog/viewer-permissions) we've heard requests for a need for increased flexibility.
As of today it's now possible to upgrade the permissions of workspace viewers in individual collections.

Simply add the viewer member to a collection and change their permission to "View and edit" the same as you might a regular member.
