We’re excited to finally add a new sign-in method, Microsoft! Whether you’re using
MS Teams, Education, or Office 365, you can now use your organization’s Microsoft
account to sign-in to Outline and build a knowledge base.

We’ll soon be working on adding Microsoft Teams integration to allow searching 
and accessing your Outline documents directly from chat too, just like Slack.


### Other fixes and improvements

- Improvements to mobile styling and functionality
- New "Page break" functionality allows splitting content across pages when printed
- Sharing functionality got a new, faster, "flyover" view
- Share links will now show when they were last accessed in the admin
- The keyboard shortcut guide got a new splash of paint and filter functionality
- Document content now expands to use more space on larger screens
- We made a number of performance improvements so Outline got _even faster_
- As always, more translated screens
