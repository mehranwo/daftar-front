![Outline custom domain](/images/custom-domains.png)


This week brings support for custom domains to the cloud hosted version of Outline.
Now you can easily have `wiki.myteam.com` or `kb.yourcompany.com` without the
hassle of hosting your own Outline servers.

Custom domains are available as an add-on for a flat rate of **$20/mo**. Interested? [Contact support](/contact) to arrange setup for your team.
